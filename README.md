# DrawingsByElle
Drawings by Elle was my final project of the Android Developer Nanodegree program with Udacity.
The app is a mock store for a local artist in Ireland, where users can view and “buy” her pictures.
The app makes use of Firebase Storage and Firestore database to store the pictures and customer order details.
Users can also add a widget to their home screen, the widget is simply one of the artists pictures and can be clicked to launch the app.
